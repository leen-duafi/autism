    what is autism 
  </h1>
  <p>
    Autism is a brain-based, developmental condition. Autistic children have communication difficulties, narrow interests and repetitive behaviour.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
Signs of autism might be noticeable in infancy or early childhood. These might include lack of interest in other people, including lack of eye contact.
    </li>
    <li>
Autism can be diagnosed from two years of age. Early diagnosis means children can have early intervention, which can make a big difference.
    </li>
    <li>
If you’re concerned that your child is showing signs of autism, contact your child and family health nurse or GP.

<h2>
  early signs 
</h2>
<p>
  It’s common to see early signs of autism in a child’s first two years. And in these years, it’s especially important to watch children’s social communication development.

For example, in the first year of life, parents of babies later diagnosed with autism notice their child’s lack of interest in other people. Many of these babies don’t make eye contact with their parents while being held or during nappy changes. The lack of other behaviour like smiling and gestures is also a sign that a child isn’t developing in a typical way.

In the first two years, other signs might be a child not responding to their name, or focusing narrowly on activities like lining up toys.

Signs of autism become more noticeable in the toddler years, as children are expected to start talking and playing with other children. Autistic children might not be interested in playing with other children, or might speak in an unusual way – for example, in a monotone.

  The National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS) provides funding for disability support and is now operating in most parts of Australia.

Parents of children with disability talk about how the NDIS works and what the transition to the NDIS has meant for them. They say the NDIS gives families more choice, more control and a more personalised plan for therapies. They say it’s comforting to know funding will be available throughout a child’s life.
